# Network Interfaces Validated Content
[![CI](https://github.com/redhat-cop/network.interfaces/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg?branch=main&event=schedule)](https://github.com/redhat-cop/network.interfaces/actions/workflows/tests.yml)[![OpenSSF Best Practices](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/projects/7650/badge)](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/projects/7650)

This repository contains the `network.interfaces` Ansible Collection.

## Description

The `network.interfaces` enable users to manage the resources Interfaces independently of platforms and perform INTERFACES health checks.

## Tested with Ansible

Tested with ansible-core 2.14 releases.

## Installation
To consume this Validated Content from Automation Hub, the following needs to be added to `ansible.cfg`:

```
[galaxy]
server_list = automation_hub

[galaxy_server.automation_hub]
url=https://cloud.redhat.com/api/automation-hub/
auth_url=https://sso.redhat.com/auth/realms/redhat-external/protocol/openid-connect/token
token=<SuperSecretToken>
```
Get the required token from the [Automation Hub Web UI](https://console.redhat.com/ansible/automation-hub/token).

With this configured, simply run the following commands:

```
ansible-galaxy collection install network.base
ansible-galaxy collection install network.interfaces
```

You can also include it in a `requirements.yml` file and install it via `ansible-galaxy collection install -r requirements.yml` using the format:

```yaml
collections:
- name: https://github.com/redhat-cop/network.interfaces.git
  type: git
  version: main
```

**Capabilities**
- `Build Brownfield Inventory`: Users want to be able to get the facts for INTERFACES resources and store it as host_vars thus enabling the capability to get facts for all the hosts within the inventory and store facts in a structured format that acts as SOT.
- `INTERFACES Resource Management`: Users want to be able to manage the interfaces, L2 interfaces and L3 interfaces configurations. This also includes the enablement of gathering facts, updating INTERFACE resource host-vars and deploying config onto the appliance.
- `INTERFACES Health Checks`: Users want to be able to perform health checks for INTERFACES resources. These health checks should be able to provide the interface's admin operational state with the necessary details.

### Usage
- This platform-agnostic role enables the user to perform INTERFACES health checks. Users can perform the following health checks:
       `all_operational_state_up`
       `min_operational_state_up`
       `all_administratnal_state_up`
       `min_administratnal_state_up`


- This role enables users to create a runtime brownfield inventory with all the INTERFACES configurations in terms of host vars. These host vars are ansible facts that have been gathered through the *_interfaces, *_l2_interfaces and *_l3_interfaces network resource module. The tasks offered by this role could be observed  below:

## Perform INTERFACES Health Checks
#### Health Checks operation fetches the current status of INTERFACES operation state health.

```yaml
health_checks.yml
---
- name: Perform interfaces health checks
  hosts: iosxr
  gather_facts: false
  tasks:
  - name: INTERFACES Manager
    ansible.builtin.include_role:
      name: network.interfaces.run
    vars:
      ansible_network_os: cisco.iosxr.iosxr
      operations:
        - name: health_check
          vars:
            details: True
            checks:
              - name: all_operational_state_up
              - name: min_operational_state_up
                min_count: 1
              - name: all_admin_state_up
              - name: min_admin_state_up
                min_count: 1
```


## Building Brownfield Inventory with Persist
#### Persist operation fetches the interfaces, L2 interfaces and L3 interfaces facts and stores them as host vars.
#### The result of a successful persist operation would be to interface facts and publish inventory host_vars to a remote repository which will act as SOT for operations like deploy, remediate, detect etc.

```yaml
- name: Persist the facts into host vars
  hosts: iosxr
  gather_facts: false
  tasks:
  - name: Network Interfaces Manager
    ansible.builtin.include_role:
      name: network.interfaces.run
    vars:
      ansible_network_os: cisco.iosxr.iosxr
      operations:
        - name: persist
      data_store:
      scm:
        origin:
          url: "{{ GH_REPO_URL }}"
          token: "{{ GH_PAT }}"
          user:
            name: ansible_github
            email: ansible@ansible.com
```

## Gather INTERFACES Facts
#### Gather operation gathers the running-config specific to interfaces, l2-interfaces and, l3-interfaces resources.

```yaml
- name: Gather Facts
  hosts: iosxr
  gather_facts: false
  tasks:
  - name: INTERFACES Manager
    ansible.builtin.include_role:
      name: network.interface.run
    vars:
      ansible_network_os: cisco.iosxr.iosxr
      operations:
        - name: gather
```

## Deploy INTERFACES Configuration
#### Read all host_vars from persisted local inventory and deploy changes to running-config.

```yaml
- name: Deploy host vars facts
  hosts: iosxr
  gather_facts: false
  tasks:
  - name: INTERFACES Manager
    include_role:
      name: network.interfaces.run
    vars:
      ansible_network_os: cisco.iosxr.iosxr
      operations:
        - name: deploy
      data_store:
        local: "~/backup/network"
```

#### Read provided resources host vars from a remote repository and deploy changes to running-config.

```yaml
- name: Deploy host vars facts
  hosts: iosxr
  gather_facts: false
  tasks:
  - name: INTERFACES Manager
    include_role:
      name: network.interfaces.run
    vars:
      ansible_network_os: cisco.iosxr.iosxr
      operations:
        - name: deploy
      data_store:
        scm:
          origin:
            url: "{{ GH_REPO_URL }}"
            token: "{{ GH_PAT }}"
            user:
              name: github_username
              email: youremail@example.com
```

## Detect configuration drift in INTERFACES Configuration
#### Detect configuration drift between local host vars and running-config. In this operation 'overridden' state is used with 'check_mode=True'

```yaml
- name:
  hosts: iosxr
  gather_facts: false
  tasks:
  - name: INTERFACES Manager
    include_role:
      name: network.interfaces.run
    vars:
      ansible_network_os: cisco.iosxr.iosxr
      operations:
        - name: detect
      data_store:
        local: "~/backup/network"
```

#### Detect configuration drift between remote host-vars repository and running-config. In this operation 'overridden' state is used with 'check_mode=True'

```yaml
- name:
  hosts: iosxr
  gather_facts: false
  tasks:
  - name: INTERFACES Manager
    include_role:
      name: network.interfaces.run
    vars:
      ansible_network_os: cisco.iosxr.iosxr
      operations:
        - name: detect
      data_store:
        scm:
          origin:
            url: "{{ GH_REPO_URL }}"
            token: "{{ GH_PAT }}"
            user:
              name: github_username
              email: youremail@example.com
```

## Remediate configuration drift in INTERFACES Configuration
#### Remediate configuration drift between local inventory host-vars and running config for given network resources.
[CAUTION !] This operation will override the running-config

```yaml
- name:
  hosts: iosxr
  gather_facts: false
  tasks:
  - name: INTERFACES Manager
    include_role:
      name: network.interfaces.run
    vars:
      ansible_network_os: cisco.iosxr.iosxr
      operations:
        - name: remediate
      data_store:
          local: "~/backup/network"
```

#### Remediate configuration drift between remote inventory host-vars and running config for given network resources.
[CAUTION !] This operation will override the running-config

```yaml
- name:
  hosts: iosxr
  gather_facts: false
  tasks:
  - name: INTERFACES Manager
    include_role:
      name: network.interfaces.run
    vars:

            user:
              name: github_username
              email: youremail@example.com
```
